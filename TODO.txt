Power Management Schematic
1) Compile a folder of datasheets for all components.
2) Ensure a name and value is given for each component.
3) Verify the schematic by reviewing all datasheets.
4) Build a library of devices for each component.
5) Do an electronic rule check.

Power Management Board
1) Create a board-level block diagram with blocks organized based on function, electrical noise, and thermal management considerations. E.g., separate the high-current battery throughput components from all other components by segmenting the ground plane.
2) Place the components on the board.
3) Draw the traces and any needed vias.
4) Do a design rule check.
5) Get a review from Ross.
6) Create a bill of materials.

Signal Processing Schematic
1) Change connector symbols to JST connections.
2) Add a uC programming interface.
3) Compile a folder of datasheets for all components.
4) Ensure a name and value is given for each component.
5) Verify the schematic by reviewing all datasheets.
6) Build a library of devices for each component.
7) Do an electronic rule check.

Signal Processing Board
  - Same as power management board.

General Notes
* use trace and via calculators for trace widths and via dimensions.
* use density level 'A' for hole and pad sizes:
	hole diameter = lead diameter + 0.25mm
	pad diameter = max{ hole diameter + 0.7mm, hole diameter x 2 }
* content listed in the bill of materials (optional fields are marked with *)
	reference designator
	type of part (crystal, inductor, etc.)
	value (frequency, inductance, etc.)
